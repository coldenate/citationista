## 🚀 Overview

Citationista is a RemNote plugin that enhances your research management and citation workflow. It offers:

-   EASY Source Management: All you have to do type /source and insert a link/file! (THAT'S IT! ![](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/5fbac4f168e2d56f0f39cac6/1x.gif))
-   Flexible Data Export: Convert your citation data into different file formats.
-   Zotero Integration: Works well with Zotero!
-   Independent Citation Management: Even if you don't use Zotero, Citationista provides its own citation management capabilities.
    -   Citationista utilizes RemNote's basic Rem Source feature to store citation data. This means that you can use Citationista without Zotero.
